# Moneyball 2.0 â€“ Predicting Player Value from Performance Metrics (Data Analytics Capstone Project)

This capstone project explores how player performance metrics can predict Wins Above Replacement (WAR) and identify undervalued MLB players based on salary. The workflow includes scraping, cleaning, modeling, clustering, and visualization to uncover actionable insights for player valuation.

## Project Objectives
- Build a regression model to predict WAR
- Normalize WAR against salary to find under/overvalued players
- Cluster players based on value and performance
- Visualize insights through interactive dashboards and figures

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd AnalyticsCapstone
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Workflow & Usage

The project is organized into modular scripts and Jupyter notebooks. The main workflow is as follows:

### 1. Data Gathering
Scrape player HTML pages for the 2025 MLB season.
```bash
python src/data/load_data.py
```
- Downloads raw HTML files to `data/raw/`.

### 2. Data Cleaning & Database Creation
Parse HTML files, extract stats and salary, and save to SQLite and CSV.
```bash
python src/data/clean_data.py
```
- Outputs: `data/processed/baseball_stats.db`, `data/processed/batters.csv`, `data/processed/pitchers.csv`

### 3. Modeling
Train regression models to predict WAR for batters and pitchers.
```bash
python src/models/train_model.py
```
- Outputs: `data/models/batters_model.joblib`, `data/models/pitchers_model.joblib`

### 4. Clustering & Value Segmentation
Cluster players by value and visualize results.
```bash
python src/clustering/clustering.py
```
- Outputs: `reports/figures/batters_value_segments.png`, `reports/figures/pitchers_value_segments.png`,
  `data/processed/batters_value_labels.csv`, `data/processed/pitchers_value_labels.csv`

## Notebooks
- `01_data_gathering.ipynb`: Scrape and collect player HTML data

## Outputs
- **Processed Data:** `data/processed/baseball_stats.db`, `batters.csv`, `pitchers.csv`
- **Trained Models:** `data/models/batters_model.joblib`, `pitchers_model.joblib`
- **Figures:** Correlation matrices, WAR distributions, value segment plots in `reports/figures/`
- **Cluster Labels:** `data/processed/batters_value_labels.csv`, `pitchers_value_labels.csv`

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Raw and processed datasets
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA, modeling, and visualization
- `src/`: Modular Python code for reusable pipelines
- `reports/`: Final report and figures
