# Moneyball 2.0 – Predicting Player Value from Performance Metrics (Data Analytics Capstone Project)

This capstone project explores how player performance metrics can predict Wins Above Replacement (WAR) and identify undervalued MLB players based on salary.

## Project Objectives
- Build a regression model to predict WAR
- Normalize WAR against salary to find under/overvalued players
- Cluster players based on value and performance
- Visualize insights through interactive dashboards

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Raw and processed datasets
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA, modeling, and visualization
- `src/`: Modular Python code for reusable pipelines
- `reports/`: Final report and figures
